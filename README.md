# House-Renting-App-

What is this program about?
- This program simulate a House Renting App. 
- There are three identities that users can choose from House owner, customer, and administrator. 
- It allows 1 owner to register and input information about their houses. Once logged out, the owner cannot access info about their houses, but the input houses info is still available for customers. 
- For customers, there are at most 5 chances for them to register and view info about houses. There is no limitation on the number of times they can rent houses, but similarly, once they log out, they would have to re-register to view info about houses. 
- Once a house is rented out, info about it would be cleared and cannot be accessed anymore. 
- Customers can haggle with the owner but they can only get a discount if their desirable discount is less than or equal to the one provided by the owner.
- The administrator can view a summary of information about the owner and the houses.
